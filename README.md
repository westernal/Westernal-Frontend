I was always bad at talking and express my feelings and I thought what if I could express my feelings through songs, unfortunately i have a bad voice :)

so I thought Westernal is a good idea.

Just in case it is the first version and has a lot of bugs that I'm sorry for them already!

## How it works?
A user can easily signup and connect with people via following them and share a song URL from Spotify, YouTube, SoundCloud and etc. (not the actual song itself because of copyright) for followers. you can like and comment on posts to interact with people.
