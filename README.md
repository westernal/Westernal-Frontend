I was always bad at talking and express my feelings and I thought what if I could express my feelings through songs, unfortunately i have a bad voice :).

So I thought Westernal is a good idea.

## How it works?
A user can easily signup and connect with people via following them and paste a song URL from Spotify, YouTube, SoundCloud and etc. (not the actual song itself because of copyright) or search a song inside app (Spotify search) to share with followers followers. You can like and comment on posts to interact with people.
